# RepairRescue
RepairRescue is a stealth startup focused on the two-wheeler servicing marketplace, founded by alumni of IIM Bangalore and a student from BIM. I worked there as an Android Developer Intern, building three apps from scratch. My work involved designing the UI in Figma and developing the apps using the latest technologies for the Android platform.
